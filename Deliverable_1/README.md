Project 1: Credibility Score for Articles

**objective**

The objective is to assess the credibility of articles, sources, or references through a credibility score. This proof of concept is grounded in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) algorithm. The use case involves:

Chatbot Integration: Initially, we have a chatbot that employs the RAG algorithm for document-specific Q&A tasks.
Resource Aggregation: RAG provides responses drawing from numerous resources.
The challenge is to understand and evaluate the credibility of these resources through a scoring mechanism.

**Approach to Scoring Credibility**

Machine Learning-Based: Utilize machine learning techniques to rate sources by analyzing features derived from those sources.
Rule-Based: Define specific rules or heuristics to assess credibility.
Hybrid Approach: Combine both ML and rule-based methods for a comprehensive evaluation.
Innovative Solutions: Consider any other creative solutions that enhance credibility assessment beyond the traditional methods.
