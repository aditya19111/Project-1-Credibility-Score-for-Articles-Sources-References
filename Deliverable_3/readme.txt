BERT-Enhanced Hybrid Neural Network for Website Rating

Overview:
This project implements a hybrid neural network model that integrates BERT embeddings with numerical inputs to rate the relevance and safety of websites. The model processes textual data using a pre-trained BERT (bert-base-uncased) transformer and combines its output with a separate fully connected network that processes numerical features such as URL ratings. The two outputs are concatenated and passed through additional layers to generate the final rating.

Features:
- BERT-based text embeddings for deep semantic understanding.
- Numeric feature integration to enrich textual data.
- Custom neural network architecture with regularization and dropout.
- Optimized with AdamW optimizer and MSE loss for regression tasks.
- Uses TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers.

Installation:
pip install tensorflow transformers pandas numpy matplotlib

Usage:
1. Load the tokenizer and model:
from transformers import BertTokenizer, TFBertModel

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
bert_model = TFBertModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

2. Preprocess Text Data:
def encode_text(texts, tokenizer, max_length=128):
    encoded = tokenizer(texts.tolist(), padding='max_length', truncation=True, max_length=max_length, return_tensors="np")
    return encoded["input_ids"], encoded["attention_mask"]

3. Create the Model:
model = create_bert_nn_model()
model.summary()

4. Train the Model:
history = model.fit(
    [train_text_ids, train_attention_masks, train_numeric], train_labels,
    validation_data=([val_text_ids, val_attention_masks, val_numeric], val_labels),
    epochs=5, batch_size=32, callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=2)]
)

Dataset:
The model expects a dataset with:
- Website textual data: Processed using BERT.
- URL rating: A numerical score assessing website credibility.
- Target variable: The predicted website relevance and safety score.

Deployment:
This model can be deployed on Hugging Face Model Hub or integrated into a live application. Example deployment script:

from transformers import pipeline
model_pipeline = pipeline("text-classification", model="your_model_path")
result = model_pipeline("This website provides accurate and safe information.")
print(result)

Future Improvements:
- Extend to multi-modal learning.
- Fine-tune BERT on domain-specific data.
- Experiment with alternative architectures like transformers for numerical inputs.
- Deploy as an API for real-time credibility scoring.
